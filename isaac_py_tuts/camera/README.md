This tutorial is on how to:

1. Spawn World and few basic objects (like Cube/Sphere/Cone)
2. Spawn a camera and capture an image using the same
3. Running a YOLO model to detect shape of the object

Note: dataset taken from Roboflow (https://universe.roboflow.com/semih-4gisc/geo-shapes-detection/dataset/1/)
